# Universitas Prasetiya Mulya Website Slicing

This website is a project where I've sliced the design of Universitas Prasetiya Mulya's website. It serves as a demonstration of HTML5 and CSS3 skills, utilizing a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout of the website.
- **CSS Grid**: Employed for creating grid-based layouts.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Utilized for flexible layout management.

## Notes

- **Responsiveness**: Please note that the website is not yet responsive for mobile and tablet versions. It's currently optimized for desktop viewing only.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.
- Add interactivity using JavaScript.
- Optimize performance and accessibility.
- Incorporate dynamic content and backend functionality if needed.
